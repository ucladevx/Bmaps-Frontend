    "description": "Free Admission!\n\nA concert featuring compositions by Herb Alpert Award recipient and flutist Nicole Mitchell. Mitchell is joined by three-time Grammy Award-winner Billy Childs on piano, vocal legend Dwight Trible, and internationally renowned bass player Mark Dresser.\n\nMitchell is an award-winning creative flutist, composer, bandleader, educator and transdisciplinary conceptualist. Mitchell believes in the transformational power of music, and she seeks to build alternative worlds that bridge the familiar with the unknown. Her mission as a flutist has been to raise respect for the instrument by developing a new improvisational language that incorporates her voice with the flute. The founder of Black Earth Ensemble, Mitchell composes for contemporary ensembles of varied instrumentation and size, while incorporating improvisation and a wide aesthetic expression. She is a Professor of Music at University of California, Irvine.\n\nParking for Jan Popper Theater is in Parking Structure 2. Find maps and parking rates here.",
