# Mappening-Frontend

## Overview

A single platform for events across campus. Mappening helps raise awareness of events by aggregating event information from various sources of advertising.

## Built With

- nginx (Port 80): Server for static files, forwards requests to backend and serves results
- Mapbox: Open source mapping platform for custom designed maps
- Angular4: Front-end web application platform
- AWS EC2/Elastic Container Service for deployment

## Setting Up the Environment

- Download [Docker](https://www.docker.com) and [Docker-Compose](https://github.com/docker/compose/releases) release 1.16.1.
- Clone this repository
  - `git clone https://github.com/ucladevx/Mappening-Frontend.git`
- Install necessary packages
  - Install yarn with `brew install yarn`
  - Import node modules with command `yarn` or `yarn install`
    - Uses `package.json` for installing packages
    - Install specific packages as needed with `yarn add <package>`
    - Install Angular CLI with `yarn global add @angular/cli`
  - Notes:
    - Commit/keep `yarn.lock` file as it changes. `package.json` defines the intended versions of dependencies while the lock files keep track of the most recently used versions.
    - You shouldn't have a `package-lock.json`, because this corresponds to the `npm` package manager and our Frontend uses `yarn` as its package manager.

#### For AWS Access

- Install [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html)
  - Configure CLI with `aws configure`
