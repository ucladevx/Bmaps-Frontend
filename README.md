# Mappening-Frontend

## Overview
A single platform for events across campus. Mappening helps raise awareness of events by aggregating event information from various sources of advertising. 

## Built With
- nginx (Port 80): Server for static files, forwards requests to backend and serves results
- Mapbox: Open source mapping platform for custom designed maps
- Handlebars.js: Templating language that separates view and code
- AWS EC2/Elastic Container Service for deployment
